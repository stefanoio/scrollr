# Scrollr
## Easy peasy smooth scrolling.

Scrollr is a small (<1KB) utility that smooths #anchor scrolling inside a page. Just drop the script in your page, no need for configuration or initialization or markup changes.
It works with links, js changes to location, manual changes to #hash by the user, and history too.

It works on any modern browser (IE10+) and has no dependency from any other libraries.

Hereâ€™s a demo: http://stefano.io/scrollr/demo.html

To build a minified version inside the dist folder you can use:
```
npm install && npm run build
```
